OverTheWire Leviathan Wargame Solution 4

Leviathan 5 takes only a few minutes to complete if you know where to look and it brings us to a fundamental concept in computing, the binary number system. Upon inspection of our new home directory we don’t see much. However, there is a trash directory here. Navigate to it to find a mysterious binary aptly named “bin”. After running it, we see sets of binary code as output. From here there are a couple of things we can do. We can copy and paste the output in an online binary to ASCII converter to translate it for us or probably use one of the tools in our shell to do this operation for us. For now, I have simply pasted it in an online converter.

Take a look at my shell output if you are lost:

After conversion of the binary output we have our password: Tith4cokei. We are ready to move along to Leviathan 6′s shell.
